# README.md_generator

## Description

Using this node script, you'll be able to quickly create a README.md file for your application!

This application was created to make it easier to create a fully featured professional ReadMe to share your project with the world.

While working on this project, I was able to practice utilizing node and its functionality including writing new files using "fs.writeFile" with Node's standard library package, using the "inquirer" module provided by the online Node Package Manager (npm) resource, as well as utilizing my own modularized code.
